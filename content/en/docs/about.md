## Introduction

When learning a new programming languages, there are usual steps one takes:

1. Learn about the syntax
2. Follow a tutorial
3. Make a project and learn new things
4. Repeat 3.

For `1.` I personally adore [Learn X in Y minutes][learnxinyminutes]. It makes
learning a new _syntax_ easier and faster. Especially if you already know the
fundamentals of programming.

However, for `2.` and `3.`, learning _idiomatic patterns_ seems to be a more
wild chase. Between random blog articles `Creating a X in Y`, `Y: making a X`;
various forum questions and answers and Youtube, there's many ways to get to the
same information.

In the spirit of [xkcd#927](https://xkcd.com/927/), I humbly wrote this website
to compile code examples that aim to help newcomers getting started with common
code patterns.

## What this site is not

- a language overview

    [Learn X in Y minutes][learnxinyminutes] is the place to go for that.

- a replacement for blogging

    Blogging is a great way to share ideas, connect, express oneself. This site
    focus on code examples, without any personal attachment to the authors.

- a replacement for online forums

    Online Q/A, debugging strive to push the community forward and this site
    wants to acknowledge the heros that are random online contributors. This
    site doesn't pretend to be a place where you can discuss and ask questions
    It is however welcomed to contribute and to improve the content here.

## What this site is trying to be

- a compilation of idiomatic examples

    Writing in Go is different that writing in Python.

    Both languages have `loops`, `ifs`, and other usual syntax elements.

    However, "writing a web server" is very different in both languages. Each have
    their own best practices, idiomatic patterns, libraries, etc.

- a standardized library

    The examples should differ only in the syntactical elements of the
    languages.

    "Writing a web server" should have the same values across each languages, so
    the understanding of one or the other is simplified.

- a community effort

    This is a place by and for the other developers. Contributions are most
    welcomed and any aspect of the website's design and content is subject to
    improvements.

- standing on the shoulder of the internet

    This site is not going to invent new ways of coding, and
    inspirations/sources ought to be cited anytime necessary.
